                    <p class="about">I am currently enrolled in the UNC-Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. During this program, I look forward to developing my skills, building my portfolio, and learning the languages needed to succeed. I have spent the last four years as a Restaurant General Manager and realized that a life in the service industry was not my goal. After seeing the variety of opportunities that the tech industry offers, I became excited to get started as soon as possible.

                    <p class="about">I grew up in Hickory, NC and attended St. Stephens High School, where I was captain of the color guard team and had first introduced myself to HTML. When the service industry had bored me, I remembered how much I enjoyed personalizing a Myspace page and how dedicated that made me to learning to do it without having to copy and paste. This led me to spend the majority of a five hour drive in a deep Google dive, searching for any and all related information. I was sold on the way technology is always growing and changing as I enjoy a challenging enviroment that will allow me to continuously grow.
