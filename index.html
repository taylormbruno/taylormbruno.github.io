                    <p>I am currently enrolled in the UNC-Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. During this program, I look forward to developing skills, building my portfolio, and learning many languages needed to succeed. I have spent the last four years as a Restaurant General Manager and have learned many great time and team management skills that will help me excel through this program and my future career.

                        I grew up in Hickory, NC and attended St. Stephens High School, where I was captain of the color guard team and was a member of the National Beta Club. After high school, my grandfather passed away and I decided to move in with my grandmother to help care for her and my two younger cousins. I spent the majority of my college years helping my family when they needed it most but now I am extremely excited to get started on my own future!
